# OpenBook

A municipal budget transparency platform. OpenBook lets towns publish their budgets online so residents can explore expenses, revenues, and capital projects in plain language.

## Town Budget Portal

Each town gets a branded portal with tabbed navigation across budget categories, summary tiles, interactive charts, searchable line-item tables, exportable data, and a printable budget book.

## Admin Dashboard

Town administrators upload budget data (CSV or Excel), customize portal branding, add plain-language tooltips for budget items, manage supporting documents, and respond to resident questions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (20 LTS recommended)
- npm 9+

### 1. Install and start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it. `npm install` generates the Prisma client, and `npm run dev` automatically creates the SQLite database and applies all migrations before starting the server. No `.env` file is required for local development — `DATABASE_URL` defaults to `file:./dev.db`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Optionally seed sample data so the portal isn't empty on first boot:

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Setting Up Your Portal

Once the dev server is running, walk through the admin flow in order. Each step is a tab in the admin header.

### 1. Create an admin account

Visit `/admin/register` to create the first admin account — the first person to register automatically becomes the admin. After that, registration is locked unless an admin is logged in. Sign in at `/admin/login`.

### 2. Configure your town (Settings tab)

Go to `/admin/setup` to set:

- **Town name and slug** — the slug becomes the URL (`/your-town-slug`)
- **Primary color** — colors chart accent and links on the public portal
- **Logo** — shown as tab icon and on page
- **Contact email** — where you want resident questions to be sent to
- **About text** — appears on the portal homepage
- **Invite code** — used by staff who self-register at `/staff/register`

### 3. Upload budget data (Upload tab)

The upload flow has three steps:

1. **Pick a category** — Expenses, Revenues, Capital Projects, or Reserves. A sample table preview appears so you can see what shape the file should take.
2. **Drop in a CSV or Excel file** — up to 10 MB. After upload, you'll see a small preview of the first two rows.
3. **Map your columns** — OpenBook auto-detects common header patterns (e.g. `FY2026 Budget`, `Department`). Anything ambiguous you label manually. If you are missing required categories, you must add them before savinging and uploading your data. Check the warnings to see what you might be missing!

Each category has its own required fields:

| Category         | Required mappings                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expenses         | Function Area, Fiscal Year Amount (with at least one set to "Budget") |
| Revenues         | Category, Fiscal Year Amount (with at least one set to "Budget")      |
| Capital Projects | Department, Purpose, Funding Source, Fiscal Year Amount               |
| Reserves         | (no public page yet — data is stored but not rendered)                |

Examples of ideal data formats can be found in the repository, under sample-data

### 4. Manage existing data (Data tab)

`/admin/data` lists every upload with its category, row count, status, and date. From here you can delete an upload (and all its rows) or wipe everything to start over. Use **Upload New Data** to add another file alongside what's already there — different categories live independently.

### 5. Polish the portal

Once data is uploaded, several optional features make the portal more useful for residents:

- **Tooltips** (`/admin/tooltips`) — hover-text explanations attached to budget categories or line items. A `?` icon appears next to any category or line item that has a tooltip on the public portal. It is generally recommended that these tooltips contain short, non-essential information.
- **Links** (`/admin/links`) — supporting external links (e.g. town meeting warrants, audit reports) that show on the portal.
- **PDFs** (`/admin/documents`) — uploadable PDF documents (annual reports, fee schedules, etc.).
- **FAQs** (`/admin/faqs`) — manage frequently asked questions that appear on the public portal's FAQ tab.
- **Requests** (`/admin/requests`) — review and approve capital expenditure requests that staff submit via `/staff`.
- **Transfer** (`/admin/transfer`) — export/import town data for moving between environments.

### 6. Preview the public site

The admin header has a **Preview** link that opens your public portal (`/[townSlug]`) in a new tab so you can see what residents will see while you're still editing.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Database**: SQLite via Prisma 7 with the better-sqlite3 adapter
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Charts**: Chart.js + react-chartjs-2
- **Data import**: PapaParse (CSV), SheetJS (Excel)
- **Auth**: scrypt-hashed passwords, HTTP-only session cookies

## Environment Variables

| Variable       | Required | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | No       | SQLite database file path (defaults to `file:./dev.db` if not set)     |

## Troubleshooting

**"Dev login failed" or 500 errors after pulling changes** — usually the local DB is out of sync with the schema. Delete `dev.db` and run `npm run dev` again — the database will be recreated automatically from the migrations.

**0 rows after uploading** — check that the column you expect to be the dollar amount is mapped to **Fiscal Year Amount**, with the **Fiscal Year** field filled in. Without those, rows can't be produced.

**Upload preview shows the wrong number of columns** — the parser uses the first row as headers. Files with title rows or blank rows above the headers won't parse correctly; trim them in your spreadsheet first.
